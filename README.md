Serial IoT Gateway
==================
The GLIDERBITS's Serial IoT Gateway is an open source (GNU GPL v3), open hardware (CC BY-SA 3.0) serial-ethernet module that you can use to very easly connect to the Internet of Things.

## How to use it

Just connect the module to your microcontroller using a serial line communication (GND, TX, RX, +5V) and send string commands to the module. Example:
```C++
Serial.println("K:xively:YOURAPIKEY\n");
Serial.println("P:xively:12345\nMyTemperature:-3.2\n");
```
That will update the MyTemperature to -3.2 in your xively account in the 12345 feed. Easy? A more complete Arduino example that updates a channel feed with an analog input value:

```C++
void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);                       // Setup serial port speed
}

void loop()
{
  String strAnalogPin0 = String(analogRead(0), DEC);  // Read analog value from channel 0
  Serial.println("K:xively:YOURAPIKEY\n");  // Set up API key
  Serial.println("P:xively:12345\nAnalogPin0:" + strAnalogPin0 + "\n"); // Post it!
  delay(60 * 1000); // 1 minute delay
}
```

## Serial Protocol

### Module configurations

"C:RESET\n" - Reset module<br>
"C:ack:0\n" - Disable acknowledge of messages<br>
"C:ack:1\n" - Enable acknowledge of messages<br>

### Data services commands
The protocol is the same for all services. However, mind that each service have different meanings for their feeds (feeds, streams, ... )

"K:service:YOUR_API_KEY\n"<br>
"P:service:optional_feed_id\nChannel_ID:value\n\n"<br>
"G:service:optional_feed_id\nChannel_ID\n"<br>

K - Configure the API Key to use in this sessions. You can setup it just once, it will keep this same API key for the next posts and gets.<br>
P - Post one or multiple data. You can send multiple "feed:value\n" in the same sequence. In the end just send '\n'<br>
G - Get one data value from service<br>

#### Xively
"K:xively:YOUR_API_KEY\n"<br>
"P:xively:feed_id\nChannel_ID:value\n\n"<br>
"G:xively:feed_id\nChannel_ID\n"<br>

#### Emoncms
"K:emoncms:YOUR_API_KEY\n"<br>
"P:emoncms:optional_node_id\nInput_ID:value\n\n"<br>
"G:service:optional_node_id\nInput_ID\n"<br>

#### Data.Sparkfun
"K:sparkfun:YOUR_API_KEY\n"<br>
"P:sparkfun:optional_feed_id\nfeed:value\n\n"<br>
"G:service:optional_feed_id\nfeed\n"<br>
